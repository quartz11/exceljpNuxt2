                  When I hear the IT consulting and software company, you might think that “technology is not good” or
                  “myself liberal arts”
                  However, IT and software, not just a “tool for the purpose of reform”
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  To polished to evolve its tools, lone of technology is required, is why we are also always pursue it.
                  However, on the other hand it more than in the us is sought, towards the goal of reform is to
                  understand the problem, I ability and spirit of challenge that leads to the resolution.
                  Even in your senior, while a liberal arts graduate, and to some people that are at the core of the
                  system development, some people have become “demon of sales” in science born in reverse.<br />
                  <br />
                  Do not do that “to fit into a mold” their potential and capabilities.
                  Is the future of Japanese companies, in order to continue to survive in global competition, to enter
                  the “Defense” is not allowed.<br />
